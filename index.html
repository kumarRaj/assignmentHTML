  				<br/>
  				Deprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature, characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because of its being superseded. The term is also sometimes used for a feature, design, or practice that is permitted but no longer recommended in other areas, such as hardware design or compliance to building codes.
